        <p class="about">The ICA was founded by a group of radical artists and writers in the 1940s as a space for experimental and challenging arts practice. It is uniquely positioned on The Mall in central London in a Regency period building designed by John Nash. Since moving to its present location in 1968, the ICA has become the home of the British avant-garde and continues to foreground interdisciplinary art practice.</p>
