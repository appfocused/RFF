		<p>Boris Khlebnikov is one of the most eminent directors and screenwriters of the New Wave of Russian cinema. Starting out in the industry as a film critic, he went on to make a name for himself as a director with the feature films Koktebel (2003, alongside Aleksei Popogrebsky) and Free Floating (2006), winning multiple major awards including the Special Jury Prize at the 2003 Moscow International Film Festival and the 2006 Best Film award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics. He is also one of the founders of the project “kinoteatr.doc”, designed to recognise and raise up new directors. His latest film, Till Night Do Us Part, is the first Russian cinema project of its kind to use crowdsourcing in its collaborative production.</p>
